About Robot 
Object Detection & Obstacle-Avoiding Line Follower Robot (Arduino) Developed a hybrid robotic system that combines line-following capabilities with real-time obstacle detection. Implemented IR sensors for path tracking and an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement. Programmed a decision algorithm on Arduino to autonomously stop, reroute, and continue motion based on obstacle presence. Enhanced stability through optimized motor control and PID-based adjustments. give short form of these line
